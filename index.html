                    <p>Love is bigger than you are. You can invite love, but you cannot dictate how, when, and where love expresses itself. You can choose to surrender to love or not, but in the end, love strikes like lightning: unpredictable and irrefutable.
                        You can even find yourself loving people you don‚Äôt like at all. Love does not come with conditions, stipulations, addenda, or codes. Like the sun, love radiates independently of our fears and desires. </p>
                    <p>May your life be filled with love, harmony, peace and energy during the coming year! I wish you a super excited birthday!</p>

                            do? Would it be ok if I could make you smile? Would it be ok if I held you awhile? Would it be ok if I kissed your face? Would it be ok if I were to replace All the men in your past that just wouldn't do And vow to be faithful
                            and always be true? Would it be alright to look in your eyes? Would it be alright to never tell lies? Would it be alright to find a way? Would it be alright to long for the day To pull you close and whisper in your ear And
                            tell you our feelings are nothing to fear? Would it be ok if I took some of your time? Would it be ok if I wrote you a rhyme? To tell you there's nothing I'd rather do Than spend my whole life loving only you..
